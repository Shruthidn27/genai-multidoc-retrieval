## Design and Implementation of a Multidocument Retrieval Agent Using LlamaIndex

### AIM:
To design and implement a multidocument retrieval agent using LlamaIndex to extract and synthesize information from multiple research articles, and to evaluate its performance by testing it with diverse queries, analyzing its ability to deliver concise, relevant, and accurate responses.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
With the exponential growth of scientific literature, manually extracting and comparing insights from multiple research papers is time-consuming and inefficient. There is a need for an intelligent agent that can automatically retrieve, summarize, and synthesize information from multiple documents. This project aims to address this challenge by implementing a multidocument retrieval agent using LlamaIndex, capable of handling natural language queries and providing accurate and concise responses from a collection of research papers.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1:
Collect and prepare research papers in PDF format. Download relevant papers such as MetaGPT, LongLoRA, and Self-RAG, and save them locally.

#### STEP 2:
Use get_doc_tools from a utility script to create vector-based retrieval and summarization tools for each paper using LlamaIndex. These tools enable semantic search and summarization functionalities.

#### STEP 3:
Initialize an agent using the FunctionCallingAgentWorker and AgentRunner classes from LlamaIndex and print the response for your query.

### RESULT:
A multidocument retrieval agent was successfully designed and implemented using LlamaIndex. The system was able to extract and synthesize information from multiple research articles and responded effectively to diverse queries. It demonstrated the ability to deliver concise, relevant, and accurate responses, validating its performance and usefulness for multi-document analysis tasks.
